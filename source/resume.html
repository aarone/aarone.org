        I'm a software developer with experience building systems and services at scale.

        I have worked at companies of various size and technical maturity.

        I spent years at Amazon helping build, scale, and improve parts of AWS and EC2 focusing on
        server provisioning, monitoring, and deployment safety.

        I'm a good writer and able to influence teams and organizations.

        I like coding, making an impact, learning new things, and helping my teammates grow.
