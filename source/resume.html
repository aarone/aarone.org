              <li>
                Build and launched a system enabling railroads to                               
	      integrate with
	      the

	      Settlement System (ISS)</a>
                and

	      EDI Network (REN)</a>, growing it from an initial                               
	      prototype to a 250K+ LOC production system.
              </li>
              <li>
                Built a comprehensive test harness for validating the                               
	      ISS system without access to a real ISS system or other carrier messages
        in a pre-production integration environment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Created a novel approach to processing X12 EDI using                               
              protobufs. Brought all of the benefits of protobufs
              (e.g. declarative model, multi-language bindings,
              efficient encoding) to the ancient X12 EDI format.
              </li>
              <li>
                Led the migration of services from AWS Lambda to gRPC/Kubernetes                               
                by establishing build and deployment infrastructure.
              </li>
              <li>
                Designed and implemented a data ingestion pipeline in Go                               
                for railcar equipment data.
